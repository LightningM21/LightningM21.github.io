<h1>Top 10 Strongest Protagonists in Anime</h1>
<img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-10-Most-Likable-Shonen-Protagonists-Ranked.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1100&h=618&dpr=1.5" alt="anime Protagonists" width="60%" height="50%" id="top_pic">    

<p id="top_text" style="text-align: left;"> Anime Fans often wonder which characters are the strongest of the animes they've seen, and I'm here to answer
    that question, from the animes I've seen of course. <strong>Keep in mind that is extremely biased and soley based on
    the shows I've seen.

<!-- Number 8 -->
<h2 style="font-size: 200%; margin: 0; color:rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.8);">8</h2>
<hr style="border-color: crimson; margin: 0%;">
<h2  style="font-size: 200%;">Tanjiro</h2>
<img src="images/tanjiro.jpg" width="70%">
<p style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: left;"> Tanjiro from the anime Demon Slayer was one of the first I had seen, and it made me excited for anime in general
     with it's increadibly <em>"flashy"</em> animations and captivating characters and anyone can tell why he's at 
    this place on the list. He's not particularly strong, and his attacks are kind of basic consisting of fire and 
water based attacks. That's all he really has, fancy swings and can throw water and fire at you. <br><br>
    His personality is like that of a cliche anime character but written by piccasso, it like a goated singer using a 
$20 dollar singing kit, good but is held back a lot in terms if potential. </p>


<!-- Number 7-->
<h2 style="font-size: 200%; margin: 0; color:rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.8);">7</h2>
<hr style="border-color: crimson; margin: 0%;">
<h2  style="font-size: 200%;">Eren</h2>
<img src="images/eren.jpg" width="70%">
<p style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: left;">Eren is a great character, in my opinion at least. Great storytelling, with the perfect
    amount of gore and pyshcopacy. I really enjoyed the 10 episodes I saw and the clips I've seen. <br><br>
His original titan doesn't make up for much but is more than enough to defeat tanjiro. It's a whole 'nother story 
if we introduce his founding titan form.  </p>

<!-- Number 6-->
<h2 style="font-size: 200%; margin: 0; color:rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.8);">6</h2>
<hr style="border-color: crimson; margin: 0%;">
<h2  style="font-size: 200%;">Meliodas</h2>
<img src="images/meliodas.jpg" width="70%">
<p style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: left;"> This show is so <strong>PEAK</strong> it was the first anime I
 had ever seen and I absolutely loved it. My favourite character at the time was definitely this guy. Seven deadly sins 
is a really good anime I would recommend to anyone.<br><br>
In terms of power level, meliodas is a beast, in his strongest form capable of destroy a whole realm just because
his presense was to powerful. Now I dont know where that would put him, but definitely above eren.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 200%; margin: 0; color:rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.8);">5</h2>
<hr style="border-color: crimson; margin: 0%;">
<h2  style="font-size: 200%;">Asta</h2>
<img src="images/asta.jpeg" width="70%,">
<p style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: left;"> This is the anime I'd seen the most recent, but I read the manga rather
    that watch the show. And I loved it, I truly could not overstate how much I did. Especially I could just sit
in the library and read it. <br><br>
 
 In terms of raw power, Meliodas is definitely stronger by a coniderable margin. But the concept of asta is all
  about anti-magic, something that would prove a challenge for Meliodas.
